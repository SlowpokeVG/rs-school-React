# Next.js. Server Side Rendering. Pages Api.

I use [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/explorer/), if you see the error 429 that means rate limit has exceeded for the api key.

Please contact me or generate your own free key and paste it into the .env file.

## Installation

- Run in console:

```
